```


Question:
How can I allow cropping an image along all axes?

Answer:
You can crop an image along all axes using the following function:
```python
stackview.crop(image)
```


Question:
How can I show an image stored in a variable `image` and a segmented image stored in a variable `labels` on top?

Answer:
To show an image and a segmented image on top, you can use the `curtain` function with parameters `image`, `labels`, and optional `alpha`:
```python
stackview.curtain(image, labels, alpha: float = 1)
```


Question:
How can I display an image stored in a variable `image` and enable slicing in three dimensions?

Answer:
You can display an image and enable slicing in three dimensions using the `orthogonal` function and passing the `image` as a parameter:
```python
stackview.orthogonal(image)
```


Question:
How can I build a user interface with sliders for numeric parameters?

Answer:
To build a user interface with sliders for numeric parameters, you can use the `interact` function with a function and the `image` parameter:
```python
stackview.interact(func, image)
```


Question:
How can I display two images side by side, with an additional overlay view of their overlap?

Answer:
You can display two images side by side with an overlay view by using the `side_by_side` function with parameters `image1` and `image2`:
```python
stackview.side_by_side(image1, image2)
```


Question:
How can I display an image with a slider to navigate through a stack?

Answer:
To display an image with a slider for stack navigation, you can use the `slice` function with the `image` parameter:
```python
stackview.slice(image)
```


Question:
How can I allow switching between multiple images and displaying them with a slider?

Answer:
To switch between multiple images and display them with a slider, you can use the `switch` function with a list of images as a parameter:
```python
stackview.switch(images:list)
```


Question:
How can I perform binary edge detection by setting only surface pixels to 1 in a destination binary image?

Answer:
You can perform binary edge detection using the `binary_edge_detection` function with source and destination arrays as parameters:
```python
cle.binary_edge_detection(source: ndarray, destination: ndarray = None) -> ndarray
```


Question:
How can I create a binary image by inverting pixel values in an input image?

Answer:
To create a binary image by inverting pixel values, you can use the `binary_not` function with source and destination arrays as parameters:
```python
cle.binary_not(source: ndarray, destination: ndarray = None) -> ndarray
```


Question:
How can I determine centroids of all labels in an image and write coordinates in a pointlist image?

Answer:
You can determine centroids of all labels in an image and write coordinates using the `centroids_of_labels` function with labels, pointlist destination, and optional include background parameter:
```python
cle.centroids_of_labels(labels: ndarray, pointlist_destination: ndarray = None, include_background: bool = False) -> ndarray
```


Question:
How can I analyze a label map to ensure all labels are indexed without gaps before returning the relabeled map?

Answer:
To analyze a label map and ensure all labels are indexed without gaps, you can use the `relabel_sequential` function with source and output arrays as parameters:
```python
cle.relabel_sequential(source: ndarray, output: ndarray = None, blocksize: int = 4096) -> ndarray
