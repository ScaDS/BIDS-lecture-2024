# Surface reconstruction

To do surface reconstruction in Napari, we need to install additional plugins packages, such as [vedo](https://vedo.embl.es/) and [napari-process-points-and-surfaces](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-process-points-and-surfaces/):

```
mamba install vedo=2022.4.1 napari-process-points-and-surfaces -c conda-forge
```
