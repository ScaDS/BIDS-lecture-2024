# Machine learning for image segmentation
In this chapter we will use _classical_ machine learning for pixel classification and object segmentation. We will use [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) for that and [APOC](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/apoc) which is a image-processing specific library which brings GPU-accelerated pixel and object classification.
